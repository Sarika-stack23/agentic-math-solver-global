## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.9+** and **pip**
- **Node.js 18+** and **npm**
- **Docker** (optional, for containerized development)

### Backend

```bash
# Clone and navigate
git clone https://github.com/Sarika-stack23/agentic-math-solver.git
cd agentic-math-solver/backend

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
# venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy environment template
cp ../.env.example ../.env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# Run the backend
uvicorn src.main:app --reload --port 8080
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork** the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. **Write clear commit messages** using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
   - `feat:` — new feature
   - `fix:` — bug fix
   - `docs:` — documentation changes
   - `refactor:` — code restructuring
   - `test:` — adding or updating tests
   - `chore:` — tooling, CI, or dependency updates
3. **Ensure tests pass** before submitting
4. **Update documentation** if your change affects the public API or user-facing features
5. **Request a review** — all PRs require at least one approval

---

## Code Style

### Python (Backend)
- Follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
- Use type hints for function signatures
- Keep functions focused and under 50 lines where possible
- Write docstrings for public functions and classes

### TypeScript (Frontend)
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and reusable
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Avoid `any` types — prefer explicit typing

### General
- No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Comment non-obvious logic
